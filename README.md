# DeLorean

DeLorean is a system to support time-traveling debugging using fast memory
checkpointing. See the DeLorean
[paper](https://www.vusec.net/download/?t=papers/delorean_issre16.pdf) for more
details. The source code will be released here during the ISSRE '16 conference.

## Status

Due to delays, the process of outsourcing the project has taken longer than
expected. The first submission will be a dump of the code that brought the
project to the publication. I will get it to compilation as soon as possible.

Also due to changes in the way the project was named, I am doing renaming of
variables and other things to match the paper. This can also affect the
successful compilation of the project. I will address that as well as soon as
possible.
